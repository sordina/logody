# logdog

Just like docker compose but with normal programs.

Aggregates logs nicely.

Config Example:

```
---
osname:
  process: uname
  args:
    - "-a"

echo:
  shell: "echo bar && sleep 1 && exit 1"
  resume:
    - fail

testscript:
  process: ./test/test.bash
  resume:
    - succeed
    - fail
```

Output:

```
$ logdog < test/processes.yaml
echo       | Starting Process P {name = "echo", runner = Shell "echo bar && sleep 1 && exit 1", resumption = Resume {succeed = False, failure = True}}
osname     | Starting Process P {name = "osname", runner = Program "uname" ["-a"], resumption = Resume {succeed = False, failure = False}}
testscript | Starting Process P {name = "testscript", runner = Program "./test/test.bash" [], resumption = Resume {succeed = True, failure = True}}
